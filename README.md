# Coverslip

## A helper for your specimens

* Live version: http://simoncozens.github.io/coverslip/
* Currently English words only. I'm working on it!
* Your font does not leave your browser
* Yes, I want to improve the dummy text too.
* Only includes words which can be shaped by glyphs in your font.

To run it yourself locally:

* `npm install`
* `npm run build`
* Deploy `index.html`, `css/`, `app.js` and `js/vendor/` to a web site
